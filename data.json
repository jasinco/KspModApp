BACK UP YOUR SAVES !!!**\r\n* ***\r\n* **DIY Kits can now be created on other planets.**\r\n    * To build a new kit you'll need the _**Ground Assembly Line**_ (a new part that you'll have to build from a DIY Kit brought from Kerbin) and a supply of _Material Kits_.\r\n    * The _Assembly Line_ will first (painfully slow) convert _Material Kits_ to _**Specialized Parts**_.\r\n    * Then you can select either a vessel from VAB/SPH, or a subassembly, and build a new DIY Kit using _Specialized Parts_, _Electric Charge_ and kerbal _engineers with Construction Skill_.\r\n    * The new kit is then spawned inside the _Assembly Line_ and pushed out. At the top it has a place (marked by a small metal plate at the center) where any stock docking port can couple, so you can use it to grab the kit and transport it elsewhere.\r\n    * Unlike kits produced on Kerbin (in Editor), off-world kits have NO recourses included. None at all. So, for example, if you build a nuclear reactor kit, on Kerbit it will include the radioactive fuel; but anywhere else you will have to find and transfer the fuel yourself.\r\n* **REMOVED workshop functionality from generic crewable parts.**\r\n    * This means that all _non-GC/non-MKS_ parts will stop work as workshops. If a base relies on them, you need to build the Mobile Workshop there before installing GC2. Or you can copy MM patch from GC1 after the installation.\r\n    * On the bright side, there's a new _**Inline Ground Workshop**_ part that has better efficiency than most of the generic workshops.\r\n* Fixed the **deployment of a kit in a time warp**; the kit doesn't jump into the air afterwards anymore.\r\n* Fixed the issue with determining the proper size of the stock RadialDrill.",

Solar Panel usgae in the VAB/SPH will now use an approxiamation\r\n\tbased on the select celestial body (default is home planet) that you can change via a new GUI window.    \r\nVastly Expanded Emergency Shutdown Procedure process (ESP), which of course can be turned on or off in the AmpYear flight window.   \r\n\tAs of this release ESP still only processes for the active vessel in flight mode. Planned future background processing is in the works.   \r\n\tAdded a GUI window and processing for Emergency Shutdown Procedure (ESP).    \r\n\tYou can now select which parts are automatically shutdown when the ESP is activated and set a priority setting for each type.    \r\n\tThere are three Priorities High, Medium and Low.    \r\n\tAll supported Parts are included in this list by default.

Here you can set the default setting for each module as to whether you want\r\n\tthem included in ESP processing or not and their priority (High, Medium, Low) if you do set their Include in ESP setting on.   \r\n\tYou will also find a Cool Down setting (in seconds) that applies after ESP processing (to stop fast recycling) the minimum value is 30 seconds.   \r\nAdded ToolTips for all the GUI windows and Icons, but future versions will look to take advantedge of new Unity 5 GUIs.\t   \r\n\tAdded Alternate Resource Panel Icons for ReservePower.   \r\n\tMassive Re-Factor of a lot of the internal code and utilities (Code Housekeeping).   \r\n\tNo longer requires AYInterfaces.dll or KKInterfaces.dll   ",

RationalResourcesParts is now home to only added parts and can be more easily ignored.\r\n* Updated Extras/RR_NuclearFamily:\r\n    * Added CarbonMonoxide NTR option.\r\n* Updated Extras/RR_TankswitchForSquad:\r\n    * Added CarbonMonoxide + Oxidizer option.\r\n    * Does not support RealFuels.",

Updated part cfg files to match.\n\t\tFound a logic hole in the PartCameraModule. When a camera isEnabled (after being activated()) it does regular checks for electric charge. Once EC gets to zero, the mod will deactivate the camera (docking cameras are unaffected) and set isEnabled & _isPowered to \"FALSE\".\n\t\tIn this state, there is no way to get back to IsEnabled = true due to there being a power state check before allowing a user to enable a camera. No EC checks are ever run again and the camera cannot be used.\n\t\tAdded code to do an ECcheck before trying to enable the camera to avoid this issue.\n\t\tFixed the kerbals being seen through parts by fixing the cullingMaskLayer",
